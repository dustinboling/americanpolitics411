#43 - remove add articles from backend

#34 - legislation - fix parentheses problem on cosponsors, etc.
#38 - FIX METHOD committee_exists/save_committee_assignment so that it always saves an assignment (might work now, so retry rake seed:committees)

#40 - Mailer specs
#41 - Helper specs
#39 - Model specs
#5 - Massive cleanup [1. remove json from controllers, 2. remove unnecessary views, 3. remove unnecessary gems]
#52 - Grab CRS legislative summary from LOC thomas
#53 - Interface for admins to put legislation into super-issues
#57 - 403 errors on person#show, most likely due to youtube. need to rescue from this. see: /people/2149-steve-king
#49 - Remove unnecessary controllers
#54 - Add 'issues which belong to this issue' on main_issue#show
#55 - make sure when an admin changes an issue name, the change is reflected in sub-issues
#58 - Add about & contact info & jurisdiction to committees/ make committees editable.
#56 - Make h1s dynamic: 'Editing organization' should be 'Editing #{name of org.}'
#60 - currently legislation#show only shows top 7 issues. need todo some jquery to show the rest.

#96 - escape should close bubble map rects
#99 - add onclicks to node texts on bubblemap

ON HOLD
==============||==
#18 - decide FOR SURE which columns must be unique, this MUST be set up before we allow final datas to be added.
#21 - add autocomplete form to topnav which shows which person admin is currently on (if they are), which allows them to also jump to another person. then check for performance with a large dataset
#19 - do we need a contact info model/database, for multiple sets of contact info per person (if, for example they have a washington address and a home-state address)
*#25 - heroku->memcache + figure out Rack::cache (this will eventually cost $, but may be necessary)
*#22 - set up gzip for assets (no longer automatically gzipped by heroku since celadon cedar)
#14 - implement friendlyID (remove params_to implementation)
#30 - Debug or implement new charts
#37 - pie chart for legislation#show: cosponsors by party
#35 - make sql queries faster. is it wise to store a ton of stuff on the person model? this will reduce most queries on person#show to one, but will make the queries on university slower. another option is to duplicate data so that a person has the names of the universities on their model, but a person_id is also stored in the university model. not DRY but perhaps the best way to get the sql queries under control.
#36 - validations: (255) length on string fields - don't know what this means
#47 - add organizations with earmarks rake task
#15 - separate admin/public layouts (including css) *on hold until bootstrap 2.0 SASS is ready - ON HOLD UNTIL DESIGN IS DONE
#16 - bubble-map: don't show a node if it doesn't have any info
#93 - loading box for legislation (difficult because there is no success callback for $.html)

CANCELED
==============||==
#20 - add counts/title to each field builder in person->edit - (not needed)
#27 - remove duplicates from legislation. there are modifiers at the end of the bills (ih, eh, etc.) need to find out which one we want then update REGEXP to remove the ones we don't want. 
#26 - while legislation->make_list is running, server is basically useless (at least in dev mode). need to make decision on how heroku is going to handle this (worker dyno, background process, one-off admin process, etc.)
#28 - Tests for CanCan authorization
#45 - need a full history of actions for each bill (can't find this, although I thought it was somewhere) 
#50 - Issue where flash messages pop up inappropriately: to reproduce: 1) edit a person's field, 2) update person 3) show person in another window 4) remove updated field 5) refresh show tab 6) flash message shows up in the show tab as well *should not happen in production*
#98 - get twitterbox to only do one request (timeline, as it contains user data)
